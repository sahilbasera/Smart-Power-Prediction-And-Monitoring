# Smart-Power-Prediction-And-Monitoring
A prototype software for power consumption prediction and monitoring  

This software runs on python version 3.4.4 and required the following dependencies :

 scikit-learn module , pandas module
 
 The current accuracy of the model revolves around 88-94% .
 
 
 The user is asked to enter the week number and then his current power consumption (this can later be automated)
 Then the accuracy of the model is printed and a warning message along with watts of excess power used is displayed
 incase the current power consumption goesbeyond predicted power consumption .
 Finally your mentioned power consumption and the recommended (predicted) power consumption are displayed
